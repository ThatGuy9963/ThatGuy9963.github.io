    <p class="text"> Freestyle also known as the front crawl is a very basic stroke it is one of the first and sometimes only strokes people learn to swim.</p><p class="text"> In freestyle you swim on your stomach in a prone position and pull your arms down through the water to propel yourself forward. To breathe in freestyle you turn your head to the side when your arm is pulled back. </p>

    <h3>In Freestyle there are not very many rules but these rules include.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="text">Stopping</li>
      <li class="text">Swimming backstroke breaststroke or butterfly in a medley</li>
      <li class="text">Not touching the wall on your turns </li>
      
      
    
    
    </ul>
    
    <p class="text"> The rules are so flexible that you could swim a different official stroke and still qualify if you were fast enough.</p>
