    <p class="text">BreastStroke is one of the slowest strokes because you need to glide a lot to swim the fastest. BreastStroke is a lot of people's favorite because it doesn't take up much energy. BreastStroke has a lot of rules. Which means there are a lot of ways to get disqualified.</p>
    <p class="text">When you are swimming Breast Stroke you look a little bit like a frog you move your arms and legs in a circular pattern and glide for speed. One thing that most people do wrong in BreastStroke is they finish their pull and their kick at the same time. What you are supposed to do is finish your pull just before you kick so you're in a streamline position when you finish your kick so you can get maximum glide. A lot of times in breaststroke you get a lot of water in your mouth that you have to spit out because the water rolls down you r face as you are breathing.</p>
